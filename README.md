# Credit Card Fraud Detection using SVM Model

## Objective :

The goal is to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machine(SVM), on highly imbalanced data sets.

## Steps Taken :

### Data Exploration :

Checked for missing and duplicate values. Explored statistical measures (mean, min, max) for both normal and fraudulent transactions.

### Data Preprocessing :

Doing a feature engineering and balanced data using undersampling. Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using stratified sampling. Trained a Support Vector Machine(SVM) model on the balanced dataset.

### Model Evaluation :

Evaluated the model's with Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC on both training and testing datasets. Achieved an accuracy of approximately 99% on the testing data.

## Conclusion :

The Support Vector Machine(SVM) model showed excellent results in detecting fraudulent transactions with a high degree of accuracy. Further improvements could involve exploring other algorithms, handling imbalanced data sets by using other techniques.

This project demonstrates the applicability of machine learning in real-world scenarios such as fraud detection, where data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation are critical for effective implementation.
